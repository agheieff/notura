## Components:
- flashcards for vocabulary building
- Sentence training
- Text training

## Two types of content - internal database, and synthetic (AI-generated) on request. Synthetic content can later be integrated in the database.

## User profile
- languages that the user already knows
- later - some estimate of user's capabilities in different fields (logical thinking, memorization, reading comprehension etc)

## User - single language profile
- Fluency - split into reading, writing, listening, and speaking
- Vocabulary by topics - grammar (core), most-used words, then by more technical topics (everyday conversation, slang, classical literature vocabulary, politics, other study fields, pc terminology)
- Imagine each field like a tree - example for medicine - at the core (easiest, everyday) level, things like "doctor", "drug, hospital", from there more specific terminology (splitting into more subfields, so to say (like "syringe", "injection"), then splitting even more into chemistry and uni-level vocabulary for students who are interested in that.
- The whole vocabulary can be visualised as a tree of topics, for each user there will be a set of preferences (what is important to them, which level they want to achieve in each topic)

## Activities:
- the user, when opening the app, will be proposed some activities to learn (review flashcards, read a text, etc). They should have an option to skip, which will affect their "mental tiredeness" level, which could lead to the system proposing less tiring activities to them
- The activities should be:
  - reading (with interactivity, where the user can click on unknown words, add them to flashcards, open up a translation of a word, a sentence etc)
  - listening - with a transcript available, and same principles applying as reading from there on
  - flashcards study - vocabulary
  - sentences study - more modular than reading texts
  - speaking - with speech recognition, then graded by an llm and recommendations given
- each session will adapt itself to the state of the user - tiredness (giving them easier or more challenging tasks), option to concentrate on some specific topics
- The user should be able to choose a specific activity, or go with the flow
- "can't listen now", "can't speak now" buttons like in the other app

## Book reading:
- The user can pick a book to read (some will be recommended as being more adapted to their level). That will follow the same logic as reading practice, but with the state being tracked, and some nice statistics (in the beginning of the book you looked up one word in 10, now at the end it's one in 30)
- The dictionary lookup can be automated, the potential errors or unclear parts looked up and manually improved
- side-by-side mode available

## Multilingual tools
- A phonetics tool - to teach IPA, how to position the tongue, accent, tones
- Grammar - identifying parts of speech, cases, word etymology and composition, conjugation concepts (maybe even grouped by language families, like "Romance conjugation"
- Correspondances - for pairs of languages, visually show things like fr. chant**Ã©** -> it. cant**ato**

## Culture study
- implement texts on the local culture, differences in etiquette etc

## Longer term plans:
- ML model for speech recognition that will give comments on the accent and pronunciation quality
